#### Step 1: Measure and Set Goals 

Answer the following questions:

1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.
Spyware
Data Theft / Leakage
Phishing Attacks

2. Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior? 
    - For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources. 
Employees need to be using a company approved VPN, Make sure the device is always locked and on yourself. Make sure not to give apps full permission as they can send sensitive data elsewhere. Company approved anti-virus to scan for malware and able to scan emails before opening.

3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently _not_ behaving according to the preferred behavior? 
    - For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders. 
Send out monthly test phishing emails and calculate the number of employees opening vs reporting activity. Monitor when a personal device is being used for work while not on VPN. Have employees send in devices for encryption before allowing them to use it for work. Use company approved software that scans apps for malicious items

4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? 
    - For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments.
0% of employees opening suspicious emails. When working 100% of employees need to be connected to VPN. If not certain work sites will not be accessible.




#### Step 2: Involve the Right People 

Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?  

- Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be. 

CISO, to pitch ideas for approval and or any changes that may need to be made.
Security Architect department for creating software for application security on personal devices
Network Security team to help setup and  protect devices that are connecting to unsecured networks. (VPN, etc)
Finance department for budgeting and cost of implementation.
HR Department for implementation of training and punishment if required by training not being completed or rules are being ignored and broken.




#### Step 3: Training Plan 

Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:

* How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)

* What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)

* After youâ€™ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? 

This portion will require additional outside research on the topic so that you can lay out a clear and thorough training agenda.

Training would be required every 6 months to a year depending on the type of risk the training is covering. Most training will be completed online unless a device has a known compromise. In that case the employee will be required to access the facility to complete training. 
Training will be covering the most common and highest risk issues while using a personal device. It will cover concerns and implications of phishing emails if care is not used. Cover data leakage and the impact it can have on the company and the individual employee if not using correct measures such as connecting to a secured network and using business supplied VPN. Will also cover the importance of using correct restrictions if or when using apps to ensure information is not being collected in regard to business and personal. Training will also cover the punishment if procedures are not followed correctly.
After training is completed I would use the same methods used previously to uncover information. Monitor is business systems are being accessed without a VPN or on a unsecure network. Send out monthly phishing emails and look for a decrease. If employees are using BYOD and personal devices have them sent in for proper encryption and applications to help protect against malicious apps.




#### Bonus: Other Solutions

Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern. 

- Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following: 
Restrict highly sensitive information for business devices only.
Implement a formal BYOD policy
    * What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical? 
 Administrative and Technical
    * What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?
Preventative, corrective, and detective
    * What is one advantage of each solution? 
Formal BYOD policy would help the company save money. Employees wouldn't need two phones
Restricting sensitive information would help limit compromising company information if a device is lost, stolen, or compromised 
    * What is one disadvantage of each solution? 
Employees may not have effective security on the phone. Such as antivirus, firewall, etc. Phone can/will be constantly monitored by business.
 Restricting information may make it harder for employees to work on the go or access to certain information that may be required at a specific time.
