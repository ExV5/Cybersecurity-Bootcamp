### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine:
  - nmap -sV 192.168.0.10
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:
  - nmap -sV -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10

  -  nmap --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10
- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability: This NSE scirpt attempts to list shares using the srvsvc.NetShareEnumAll MSRPC function and retrieve more information about them using srvsvc.NetShareGetInfo. If access to those functions is denied, a list of common share names are checked.

  2. Why is it dangerous: An attacker may be able to leverage this to read (and possibly write) files on remote hosts

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server: Restrict access, cur inbound SMB access at corporate firewalls, apply security patches
